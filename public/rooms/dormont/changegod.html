    (Statues, big and small, all with different faces.)
    (Some of them have sad eyes, others a bright smile.)
    (A few are animated by Craft, and one jumps around and bumps gently into your foot.)
    (The Change God, deity worshipped by all of the country of Vaugarde, stands before you.)
    (You have trouble believing you're finally here, almost at the end of your journey.)
    (It was only a few months ago that you met Mirabelle.)
    (So much has happened since then.)
    and then the event trigger
    (It was almost a year ago now that the King appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.)
    (Possessing immense Craft power, he spread his Curse across the country of Vaugarde, freezing in time everything in its path.)
    (With Dormont's House of Change in his control, he patiently waits,\\!\\ for he knows his Curse can only be reversed if he is defeated.)
    (His victory would be all but determined, if not for Mirabelle.)
    (Your friend Mirabelle is the only survivor of the House of Dormont, after the King froze everyone inside in time and locked the gates.)
    (Everyone says she was blessed by the Change God themselves with the power to fight back the King's Curse...)
    (...making her the only one able to save Vaugarde.)
    (When you met her, she was already traveling with Isabeau and Odile, trying to get the orbs necessary to open the House's gates and defeat the King.)
    (You helped them defeat a particularly strong Sadness, and, seeing your strength, they asked for your help.)
    (You had nothing better to do, so you decided to accompany them.)
    (A few weeks later, you met Bonnie, completing your little team.)
    (You saw a lot of Vaugardian cities during your travels, some frozen, some not, and did your best to sidestep the slowly encroaching Curse.)
    (But still, you all kept going.)
    (Mirabelle kept going to honor the Change God's blessing, save her beloved House, and save Vaugarde.)
    (Isabeau came with her after Vaugarde's Defenders themselves refused to help.)
    (Odile came to satisfy her curiosity about Vaugarde...)
    (...and because, she said, \"leaving the fate of a country to a bunch of young ones would give me an ulcer\".)
    (Bonnie came to save their sister, frozen by the Curse.)
    (You're here because there's nothing else for you to do.)
    (What else are you supposed to do except travel with them?)
    (Once, Mirabelle asked you if you were okay, following them on a journey to save the country.)
    (She felt guilty, felt like she was forcing everyone to follow her on a hopeless quest.)
    (You wanted to put her at ease, so you said easily and truthfully that traveling with everyone was the happiest you could remember being.)
    (She looked upset.)
    (You cringe just thinking about it, truth be told.\\!\\ Maybe not the most considerate thing you could've said to someone with her problems at that moment.)
    (But tomorrow, one way or another, your journey will end.)
    (...)
    (...\\!You should believe something very strongly at the Change God.)
    (That's how those work, right?\\!\\ Mirabelle and Isabeau taught you before.)
    (Can't just ask for things because the Change belief considers this lazy.\\!\\ It's the Change God, only pure belief and confidence in yourself will do, with the Change God only providing a little nudge.)
    (If anyone is lazy here, it must be the Change God, you think.)
    (Oh well.)
    (You...\\!\\ \"believe strongly\", or whatever...)
        (...that your hits will super hurt.)
            (Best defense is a good offense.\\!\\ If you hit hard, no one will hurt you or your friends.)
            (You repeat under your breath \"super powerful, super powerful, super powerful.\")
            (...\\m[wait]You actually feel a little more powerful???)
            (You do a little flourish with your dagger.)
            (...You dropped your dagger.)
            (Embarrassing!)
            (You and your \\v[284]'s ATK got a tiny bit better!)
        (...that attacks against you will be super weak.)
            (Best offense is a good defense.\\!\\ You win if you and your friends are the only ones standing.)
            (You repeat under your breath \"super strong, super strong, super strong.\")
            (...\\m[wait]You actually feel a little stronger???)
            (You pinch yourself.)
            (Ouch.\\!\\ Okay then, not that much more powerful.)
            (You and your \\v[284]'s DEF got a tiny bit better!)
        (...that you'll be super fast.)
            (Always attack first.\\!\\ Don't leave the enemy a chance to touch you.)
            (You repeat under your breath \"super fast, super fast, super fast.\")
            (...\\m[wait]You actually feel a little faster???)
            (You jump in place, trying to notice if anything changed.)
            (You jump right on a pointy rock.)
            (You don't tear up.)
            (Not that much agile then, huh.)
            (You and your \\v[284]'s ATKSPD got a tiny bit better!)
    [Going to the Change God's statue will boost one stat of your choice!]
    [You can also save your progress by praying at the Change God's statue!]
    (Wow!\\!\\ Okay, that's enough for today.)
    (You thank the Change God for its blessing and quickly run away, crossing it out from the Reminder Note.)
