    <p class="dialogue-note">First time approaching the Change God statue in Act 2</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(You approach the Change God's statue.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(It's still here, looking down at you...)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(Would the Change God be mad if you got a blessing again?)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(...Would it know?)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-note">Same choices/dialogue as Act 1</p>

    <p class="dialogue-note">Second time approaching the Change God statue in Act 2</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(The Change God's blessing has been reset now that you're back in Dormont, so time to get a new one.)</p>

    <!--same dialogue tree except friends will be allies in the stat raised text this time-->

<h1 id="monologue">Act 1 monologue</h1>

<div class="dialogue">

    <p class="dialogue-line">(Statues, big and small, all with different faces.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(Some of them have sad eyes, others a bright smile.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(A few are animated by Craft, and one jumps around and bumps gently into your foot.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(The Change God, deity worshipped by all of the country of Vaugarde, stands before you.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(You have trouble believing you're finally here, almost at the end of your journey.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(It was only a few months ago that you met Mirabelle.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(So much has happened since then.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-note">The flashback cutscene begins</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(It was almost a year ago now that the King appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Possessing immense Craft power, he spread his Curse across the country of Vaugarde, freezing in time everything in its path.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(With Dormont's House of Change in his control, he patiently waits, for he knows his Curse can only be reversed if he is defeated.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(His victory would be all but determined, if not for Mirabelle.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Your friend Mirabelle is the only survivor of the House of Dormont, after the King froze everyone inside in time and locked the gates.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Everyone says she was blessed by the Change God themselves with the power to fight back the King's Curse...)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(...making her the only one able to save Vaugarde.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(When you met her, she was already traveling with Isabeau and Odile, trying to get the orbs necessary to open the House's gates and defeat the King.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You helped them defeat a particularly strong Sadness, and, seeing your strength, they asked for your help.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You had nothing better to do, so you decided to accompany them.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(A few weeks later, you met Bonnie, completing your little team.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You saw a lot of Vaugardian cities during your travels, some frozen, some not, and did your best to sidestep the slowly encroaching Curse.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(But still, you all kept going.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(Mirabelle kept going to honor the Change God's blessing, save her beloved House, and save Vaugarde.)</p>
        
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Isabeau came with her after Vaugarde's Defenders themselves refused to help.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Odile came to satisfy her curiosity about Vaugarde...)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(...and because, she said, "leaving the fate of a country to a bunch of young ones would give me an ulcer".)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Bonnie came to save their sister, frozen by the Curse.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You're here because there's nothing else for you to do.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(What else are you supposed to do except travel with them?)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Once, Mirabelle asked you if you were okay, following them on a journey to save the country.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(She felt guilty, felt like she was forcing everyone to follow her on a hopeless quest.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You wanted to put her at ease, so you said easily and truthfully that traveling with everyone was the happiest you could remember being.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(She looked upset.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(You cringe just thinking about it, truth be told. Maybe not the most considerate thing you could've said to someone with her problems at that moment.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(But tomorrow, one way or another, your journey will end.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(...)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(...You should believe something very strongly at the Change God.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(That's how those work, right? Mirabelle and Isabeau taught you before.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Can't just ask for things because the Change belief considers this lazy. It's the Change God, only pure belief and confidence in yourself will do, with the Change God only providing a little nudge.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(If anyone is lazy here, it must be the Change God, you think.)</p>
    
    <p class="dialogue-line">(Oh well.)</p>

    <p class="dialogue-line">(You... "believe strongly", or whatever...)</p>
